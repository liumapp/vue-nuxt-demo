## how to use

### directory structure

* assets

    The assets directory contains your un-compiled assets such as Less, Sass or JavaScript.

* components

    The components directory contains your Vue.js Components. Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge the data method on these components.

* layouts

    The layouts directory contains your Application Layouts.

* middleware

    The middleware directory contains your Application Middleware. Middleware lets you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages (layouts).
